# Coffee_Machine_Program
In this project using Python I simulate a vending coffee machine that works with AU$ coins.
The user can select a drink, pay the price and receive the change. The owner can access to the ingredients, and the money statistics. Finally, he can turn off the machine. When there are not enough resources or the money inserted is not enough a message will be displayed.
